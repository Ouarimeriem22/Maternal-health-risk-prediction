# Maternal-health-risk-prediction
Maternal health risk prediction identifies pregnancy complications to prevent maternal and neonatal mortality. This project uses machine learning to predict health risks, enabling early intervention and better outcomes. We aim to develop a robust model to classify risk levels accurately using advanced data analytics and key health indicators.
